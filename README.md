# Home_Thermal_Management
EECS 3215 Project - Arduino

The Home Thermal Management System project is an wifi-enabled embedded system that measures and displays the change in temperatures around the house whilst alerting the user of unusual temperature changes via an alarm system. 

As engineering students, we have gained a lot of theoretical knowledge over the course of our undergraduate years, therefore we chose to build this particular system as a project, because it is an excellent combination of our knowledge of electric circuits, software, and IoT.
